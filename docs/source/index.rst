Welcome to the SMC Verifiable Plugins documentation!
========================================================

This package provides with the base class that must be used to develop plugins compatible with Statistical Model Checking, together with some helper function for loading them into a model checker.

This plugins can be referenced in a JANI file to be integrated into a model, that can be loaded by a model checker to run verification.

At the current state, we provide support for the SMC Verifiable Plugins in `smc_storm <https://github.com/convince-project/smc_storm>_`.
